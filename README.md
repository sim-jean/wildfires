## Wildfires
Protecting human societies and biodiversity from wildfire risks

# Project 1 : modeling wildfires
 - First, I attempt to review and compare fire spread models using cellular automata rather than vector-based models (differential equations), on fictional landscapes for ground fires
 - Second, I leverage rich data environments to assess actual performances of different models
 - Third, I will try to develop additional modules of fire spread, notably on crown fires, which characterize the current fire regimes. 
 - Fourth, build on recent advances in optimization, computer science and machine learning to increase the accuracy of the model
 - Fifth, based on statistics, notably Zero Inflated Poisson Regression, try to predict the number of ignitions, and allocate them on the landscape. This procedure will follow a prescription rule based on the gradient of the regression. 
 
# Project 2 : biodiversity module
 - First, review of living species in the case study forest land
 - Second, learn how to model the species and learn the various aspects of biodiversity
 - Three, simulate behavior of species considering habitat (amount, quality, connectedness...)
 
# Project 3 : evaluate the efficacy of measures
 - First, map margins of operations to their impact in terms of modeling component : this can mean literature review, or prospective analysis.
 - Second, simulate the impact in terms of burnt area, severity, intensity, and try to come up with an updated version of a burn probability
 - Third, get data on costs and map to a cost function. 
 - Fourth, get data on losses and avoided losses and update burn probabilities
 
# Project 4 : try and map this to insurance economics
