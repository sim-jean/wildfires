# This folder stores the different spreading models

3 are developed : 
- A probabilistic spread model using Bernoulli spread, and probability of spread depends on observables.
- A mechanistic model based on eliptical spread and convex hulls, to grasp the idea of the models developed for USFS
- A mechanistic model based on cellular automata based on HFire (Peterson et al, 2009)
